						<li><h3>What is a cookie?</h3> A cookie is a small piece of data, typically consisting of letters and numbers. When you visit a website, the website may send a cookie to your browser. Subsequently, the browser may store the cookie on your computer or mobile device. Cookies are designed to allow the recognition of your device and collection of certain information about your use of websites. Thus, over time, cookies allow websites to “remember” your actions, login details, settings, and preferences. There are several types of cookies, namely, (i) persistent cookies, which remain valid until their expiration date or until deleted and (ii) session cookies that are stored on a web browser and remain valid until the moment the browser is closed. Cookies may also be (i) first-party cookies (set by the website itself) and (ii) third-party cookies (placed by third-party websites).</li>
